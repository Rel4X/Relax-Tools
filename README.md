Relax-Tools
===========

Relax Tools is a tool box with easy to use classes for Random, String, Socket and FileSystem ...


Well, all those classes can be improved and optimized ... but I'll do it when I'll need to.



+--------------+
| RxWinFs v1.0 |
+--------------+
- Only available on Windows.
- Missing a HardDeleteADir() function to recursively delete a directory.

+---------------+
| RxRandom v1.0 |
+---------------+
- Missing a function to random between two signed numbers.
- Missing a function to random between two floats / doubles.

+----------------+

+---------------+
